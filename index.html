   <p><strong>Hello World!</strong></p>

    <p><strong><pre>About Me</pre></strong></p>
    <p>My name is <em>Emma Melton</em>, and
         I am a <em>sophomore</em> at Davidson College.
         I am an <em>intended History major</em>.

 <div id="why are you taking this course?">
  <br>
   <p><strong><pre>Why Am I Taking This Course?</pre></strong></p>
   <p>I am taking this class because although I am planning
      to be a History major, I wanted to explore a second
      major. Moreover, I was looking for a course that
      would use the quantitiative side of my brain more, as
      I felt it would be a good break from my normal readings.
      I planned to take CSC-121 this semester, but as I
      previewed other courses, I found this one. I
      <strong>loved</strong> the course description.
      I personally enjoy creating websites and digital
      designs, so I made an effort to switch into
      DIG-245. Add/Drop was kind to me, to say the least.

 <div id="what experience do you have in programming">
  <br>
   <p><strong><pre>What Experience Do I Have...?</pre></strong></p>
   <p>My experience of personal creation is limited to
      drag-and-drop platforms. I use Weebly often for my
      website designs, and I use Canva for my graphic
      designs. I have a website through Weebly
      for the soccer camp I direct, and I use Canva for
      much of our marketing. Both my website and graphic
      design experience was for the web. My programming experience
      is really only programming a house I created to
      turn on it's lights when the user pressed their
      left-button on their mouse. This was in my foundations
      of computer science course.

 <div id="what are your goals in this course">
  <br>
   <p><strong><pre>My Goals</pre></strong></p>
   <p>I want to have the skills to create websites that are
      both professional and engaging to use. I would like to
      create my own website, perhaps a blog or develop a new
      website for my camp that is no longer required to operate
      under Weebly.
       <a href="https://fastandfuriousfeetsc.weebly.com"
       target="_blank">This is the current camp website!</a>
      I would also like to further my knowledge of
      the internet. I found the course description
      interesting in its mentioning of the internet
      (and it's development) as a communicative platform.

<!-- talk about the filesystem -->
 <div id="learn-computing project">

    <p><strong><pre>Learn-Computing Summary</pre></strong></p>
    <p>In the filesystem section, users learn that basically
      everything is a file, because a folder is just a type
      of file, and a program is a file that is packaged with
      other files. Users also explore more about terminal by
      proxy of the user permissions section where it explains
      the rightmost column that generates when terminal lists
      files. After reading about [r]ead, [w]rite, and e[x]ecute,
      users learn about file organization. The section also
      educates about file extensions and hidden files. I
      personally didnâ€™t realize these files existed, so I
      found that portion especially interesting. My favorite
      part of this lesson that readers learn is that one can
      bookmark their user directory in Finder instead of
      accessing it through the hard drive icon on the desktop
      and having to go from it, to the users folder, to the
      specific user, to the folders the person needs. (145 words)

    <ol>
     <li><a href="https://intothetrenches.1917.movie"
          target="_blank">1917 Movie Website</a>
        The <strong>1917 Movie</strong> was my top website of choice
        because of its originality, creativity, and engaging
        interface that made the movie (which I haven't seen)
        something that I desperately want to watch. I thought
        the way the web designers combined an interactive
        experience with both movie scenes and behind-the-scenes
        shots made the website not only captivate
        an audiences' attention, but also made viewers want to know
        more about the movie.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.law.virginia.edu"
          target="_blank">UVA Law Website</a>
        The <strong>University of Virgina Law School</strong>
        website was another one where I just kept wanting to
        explore it. I personally aspire to apply (and get
        accepted into) the law school, so I find the website
        interesting. I also thought the organization of the
        site is quite clean, especially in the consistency
        from page to page. I learned in the Humanities course
        how to create web pages that were extensions of the main
        site but only accessible by the particular link (and would
        be otherwise hidden). UVA law incorporated that in links
        like their library and give pages, as they open to different,
        separate-looking pages, that are still subsets of the main
        UVA Law site. (You just have to hit the home logo or where it
        says UVA Law.)</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.humaninteraction.com"
          target="_blank">Human Interaction Website</a>
        The <strong>Human Interaction Website</strong> attracted
        me through not only its cause for creation (what the
        Human Interaction was... it just seemed cool), but also
        it's design with colors, text, fonts, colored blocks,
        and photos or videos. It was a very engaging website
        that I felt was always revealing something else on the
        next page.

   <p><strong><pre>Difficulties</pre></strong></p>
   <p>The most difficult part of this project was just making sure
      I was formatting my code the best way. I also would get
      frustrated when Atom would assume I wanted to insert a coding
      command instead of the paragraphs I was typing because it thought
      I was just coding, not writing responses to questions. Other
      than that, I thought coding in HTML was not too hard.</p>
