      <p><strong>Hello World!</strong><p>
      <br>
        <p>My name is <em>Emma Melton</em>, and I am a <em>sophomore</em>
           at Davidson College. I am an <em>intended History major</em>, but
           am also looking at a second major.</p>

    <div id="why are you taking this course?">
      <br>
        <p>I am taking this class because I am planning to be a History
          major, but I personally also wanted a course that would use
          the quantitiative side of my brain. Although I love learning
          history, I also enjoy breaks from readings. I was planning
          on taking CSC-121 this semester, but as I previewed courses
          to take instead of CSC-121, I found this one. I <strong>loved</strong>
          the course description. I personally enjoy creating websites
          and digital designs, so I made an effort to switch into this course.
          Add/Drop was kind to me, to say the least.</p>
