    <p><strong>Hello World!</strong></p>
    <br>
      <p>My name is <em>Emma Melton</em>, and
         I am a <em>sophomore</em> at Davidson College.
         I am an <em>intended History major</em>, but
         am also looking at a second major.

  <div id="why are you taking this course?">
   <br>
    <p>I am taking this class because I am planning
         to be a History major, but I wanted a course
         that would use the quantitiative side of my brain.
         Moreover, I wanted to explore a second major.
         Although I love learning history, I also enjoy
         breaks from readings. I was planning on taking
         CSC-121 this semester, but as I previewed courses
         to take instead of CSC-121, I found this one.
         I <strong>loved</strong> the course description.
         I personally enjoy creating websites and digital
         designs, so I made an effort to switch into
         this course. Add/Drop was kind to me, to say the least.
     </p>
  <div id="what experience do you have in programming">
   <br>
    <p>My experience of personal creation is limited to
       drag-and-drop platforms. I use the Weebly platform
       often for my website designs, and I use Canva for
       my graphic designs. I have a website through Weebly
       for the soccer camp I direct, and I use Canva for
       much of our marketing. Both my website and graphic
       design experience was for the web. I also printed many
       of my marketing posters. My programming experience is
       really only programming a house I created to
       'turn on it's lights' when the user pressed their
       left-button on their mouse. This was in my foundations
       of computer science course.

  <div id="what are your goals in this course">
   <br>
    <p>I want to have the skills to create websites that are
       both professional and engaging to use. I would like to
       create my own website, perhaps a blog or develop a new
       website for my camp that is no longer required to operate
       under Weebly.
          <a href="https://fastandfuriousfeetsc.weebly.com" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">
          This is the current camp website!</a>
      I would also like to further my knowledge of
      the internet. I found the course description
      interesting in its mentioning of the internet
      (and it's development) as a communicative platform.</p>

          <li><a href="https://intothetrenches.1917.movie" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">1917 Movie Website</a>
            The <strong>1917 Movie</strong> was my top website of choice
            because of its originality, creativity, and engaging
            interface that made the movie (which I haven't seen)
            something that I desperately want to watch. I thought
            the way the web designers combined an interactive
            experience with both movie scene and behind the scenes
            shots made the website not only sell the movie/captivate
            an audiences' attention, but it also made me want to keep
            learning about the movie.</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.feedmusic.com/#/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Feed Music Website</a>
            The <strong>FeedMusic</strong> website was my second choice,
            due to its intriqute design that captivates your attention
            through animation and video. I have no idea what Feed is or
            its desire or purpose, but I do know that they are all about
            keeping a person's online-presence their own, without the
            threat of information being taken when the user does not
            want that. It captivated me through its animations and made
            me want to keep going to continue to learn more, just so I
            could explore more of the website.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.humaninteraction.com" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Human Interaction Website</a>
            The <strong>Human Interaction Website</strong> attracted
            me through not only its cause for creation (what the
            Human Interaction was... it just seemed cool), but also
            it's design with colors, text, fonts, colored blocks,
            and photos or videos. It was a very engaging website.

<div id="difficulties"
  <br>
    <p>The most difficult part of this project was just making sure
      I was formatting my code the best way. I also would get
      frustrated when Atom would assume I wanted to insert a coding
      command instead of the paragraphs I was typing because it thought
      I was just coding, not writing responses to questions. Other
      than that, I thought coding in HTML was not too hard.</p>
