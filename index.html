      <p><strong>Hello World!</strong><p>
      <br>
        <p>My name is <em>Emma Melton</em>, and I am a <em>sophomore</em>
           at Davidson College. I am an <em>intended History major</em>, but
           am also looking at a second major.</p>

    <div id="why are you taking this course?">
      <br>
        <p>I am taking this class because I am planning to be a History
          major, but I wanted a course that would use the quantitiative side
          of my brain. Moreover, I wanted to explore a second major.
          Although I love learning history, I also enjoy breaks from
          readings. I was planning on taking CSC-121 this semester, but as
          I previewed courses to take instead of CSC-121, I found this one.
          I <strong>loved</strong> the course description. I personally
          enjoy creating websites and digital designs, so I made an effort
          to switch into this course. Add/Drop was kind to me,
          to say the least.</p>
  <div id="what experience do you have in programming">
    <br>
      <p>My experience of personal creation is limited to drag-and-drop
          platforms. I use the Weebly platform often for my website designs,
          and I use Canva for my graphic designs. I have a website through Weebly
          for the soccer camp I direct, and I use Canva for much of our
          marketing. Both my website and graphic design experience was for the
          web. I also printed many of my marketing posters. My programming
          experience is really only programming a house I created to 'turn on it's lights'
          when the user pressed their left-button on their mouse. This was in my
          foundations of computer science course.</p>
